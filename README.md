# aws-migration

This is work in progress Ruby code that I plan to use in Red Hat CloudForms to allow migration of on-prem virtual machines to Amazon Web Services using CloudForms automation. 


Also requires my "s3play" playbook from my general ansible-playbooks repo - https://github.com/jritenour/ansible-playbooks/blob/master/s3play.yml.

Both of these items will become much more fleshed out, and I'll add more support for dynamic variables in the near future.  For now theres still a lot of hardcoded values.
